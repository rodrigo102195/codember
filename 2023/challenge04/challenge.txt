**File System Compromised by Hackers**
In a world where information is power, a hacker known as Savipo Yatar discovers a series of files on a highly protected server.

These files contain secrets that could change the course of history. But there's a problem: some of the files are fake, designed to deceive intruders. Savipo Yatar must quickly determine which files are real and which are fake.

Each file has a name with two parts, separated by a hyphen (-). The first part is an alphanumeric string, and the second is a checksum, which is a string formed by characters that only appear once in the first part and in the order they appear.

Write a program that determines whether a file is real or fake based on these rules.

Examples:

File Name: xyzz33-xy
Result: ✅ Real (The checksum is valid)

File Name: abcca1-ab1
Result: ❌ Fake (The checksum should be b1, it's incorrect)

File Name: abbc11-ca
Result: ❌ Fake (The checksum should be ac, the order is incorrect)

Each line indicates the file name and its corresponding checksum, separated by a hyphen (-).

**How to Solve It:**
1. Analyze the list of file names and their checksums that you will find in this file: [files_quarantine.txt](https://codember.dev/data/files_quarantine.txt)

2. Find the 33rd real file (out of all the real files, the 33rd in order of appearance) and submit its checksum. For example, if the file is xyzz33-xy, you would do:
   ```
   submit xy
   ```
