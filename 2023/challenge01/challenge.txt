The Challenge
A spy is sending encrypted messages.

Your mission is to create a program that helps us search for patterns...

The messages consist of words separated by spaces like this:
cat dog dog car Cat DOg sun

We need the program to return the number of times each word appears in the message, regardless of whether it's in uppercase or lowercase.

The result will be a text string with the word and the number of times it appears in the message, in this format:
cat2dog3car1sun1

The words are ordered by their first appearance in the message!

More Examples:
keys house HOUSE house keys -> keys2house3
cup cuP CuP cup -> cup2cuP1CuP1
houses house houSehouses -> houses1house1houSe1

How to Solve It

Solve the message you'll find in this file: https://codember.dev/data/message_01.txt

Submit your solution using the "submit" command in the terminal, for example like this:
submit dog3cat3car1sun1
